# Simon Game

This is a simple implementation of the classic Simon game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game challenges the player to repeat a series of button presses in the correct order. The sequence gets longer with each successful round, testing the player's memory and pattern recognition.

## Game Overview

The Simon Game starts when the player presses any key. The game will light up one of the four colored buttons, and the player needs to press the buttons in the same order. Each time the player successfully repeats the sequence, the game adds an additional step to the sequence, making it progressively harder.

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (jQuery)
